# Gaetano's Portfolio Website

[My portfolio website](http://http://gvenezia.com/) showcases my various projects, tells you about me, and provides contact information.

The website uses responsive design created with just HTML and CSS. 

Font Awesome is utilized for icons. Google Fonts imports my two main fonts, Dosis and Kreon.
